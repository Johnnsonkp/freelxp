Priority Implementation Order
1. Week 1: Full TypeScript migration + ESLint strict rules
2. Week 2: Testing setup (unit + integration)
3. Week 3: Layered architecture refactor
4. Week 4: Design patterns + DI implementation
5. Week 5: Error handling + logging + monitoring
6. Week 6: Performance optimization + documentation

Additional Stand-Out Additions
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions with test coverage, Lighthouse CI
- Monitoring: Sentry error tracking, Vercel Analytics

Bottom Line: Your current project shows good fundamentals, but lacks the architectural maturity and engineering rigor expected at senior level. The improvements above demonstrate systems thinking, scalability awareness, and production-ready code quality that senior roles demand.
